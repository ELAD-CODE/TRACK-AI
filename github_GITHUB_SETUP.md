# GitHub recommended protection rules

- Protect main branch: require pull request reviews before merging.
- Require status checks: CI build, tests, gitleaks.
- Enable 'Require linear history' and 'Require signed commits' if desired.
- Optionally enable auto-merge but only after all required checks pass and approvals.
